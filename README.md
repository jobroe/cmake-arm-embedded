# About

The aim of this project is to provide a software development environment based on CMake, GCC and openOCD for several bare metal ARM platforms.

## Requirements

* CMake >= 3.6
* GCC arm-none-abi
  * Linux Arch: `arm-none-eabi-gcc` `arm-none-eabi-binutils` `arm-none-eabi-newlib`
  * Ubuntu packages: Since the package of the official repo is very old it is recommended to use this [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~team-gcc-arm-embedded/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)

## Features

* General CMake Toolchain file for arm-none-eabi-gcc
* Target specific extension of Toolchain file

## Usage

Add this project as git submodule to your repository:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/jobroe/cmake-arm-embedded.git cmake
```

Set the Linker Script and include the target specific cmake module in your project CMakeLists.txt e.g.:

```cmake
set(LINKER_SCRIPT "${Gecko_SDK_PATH}/platform/Device/SiliconLabs/EFR32MG12P/Source/GCC/efr32mg12p.ld")

include(efr32mg)
```

Go to your project root directory, create build directory and enter it:

```sh
mkdir build

cd build
```

run to configure:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-arm-none-eabi.cmake ..
```

and finally to build:

```sh
make
```
